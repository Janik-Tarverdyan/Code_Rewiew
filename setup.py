    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/

    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is

    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file

    #   py_modules=["my_module"],

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. If you
